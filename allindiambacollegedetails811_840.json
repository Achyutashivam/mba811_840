The facilities present a different image: although the classrooms are kept in excellent condition, there is no Wi-Fi, and the hostels are not very clean and serve food that may be unsettling. While the canteen offers a basic amenity, the absence of sports programmes, medical facilities, and security makes one wonder about the general well-being of students.The best thing about the faculty is how well-trained they are, though some students might find it difficult to learn in regional languages rather than English. Exams are generally thought to be easy, but there is a drawback: inconsistent grading procedures irritate students. Exams during the semester are especially difficult and contribute to academic stress. Bodoland University life is essentially a mix of positives like well-kept classrooms and committed faculty members and negatives like poor facilities and difficulties with exams.",

              "answer": "Bodoland University life offers a varied assortment of experiences. The facilities present a different image: although the classrooms are kept in excellent condition, there is no Wi-Fi, and the hostels are not very clean and serve food that may be unsettling. While the canteen offers a basic amenity, the absence of sports programmes, medical facilities, and security makes one wonder about the general well-being of students.The best thing about the faculty is how well-trained they are, though some students might find it difficult to learn in regional languages rather than English. Exams are generally thought to be easy, but there is a drawback: inconsistent grading procedures irritate students. Exams during the semester are especially difficult and contribute to academic stress. Bodoland University life is essentially a mix of positives like well-kept classrooms and committed faculty members and negatives like poor facilities and difficulties with exams.",
